detecting object using yolo


Introduction:

In recent years, computer vision has witnessed significant advancements, reshaping industries ranging from autonomous vehicles to healthcare. One of the fundamental tasks within computer vision is object detection, which involves identifying and localizing objects within an image or video frame. The YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm represents a breakthrough in object detection, offering remarkable speed and accuracy, thus revolutionizing real-time object detection applications.

This project focuses on exploring and implementing the YOLO algorithm for object detection. Developed by Joseph Redmon and Santosh Divvala in 2016, YOLO stands out for its ability to detect objects in images swiftly and accurately in a single forward pass of the neural network. Unlike traditional object detection methods that rely on sliding windows or region proposal networks, YOLO formulates object detection as a regression problem, directly predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities for multiple objects simultaneously.
